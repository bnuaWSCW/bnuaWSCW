Hello, I am Brandon - a student in the class of Digital Technology in Western Springs College. My most common attribute that I love is sports. I play volleyball for club as well as for my school. I love volleyball's intensity and fast-paced environment. I additioanlly play rugby and golf - though I do not play on a serious note such as how I play volleyball. In relation to sports and volleyball, I have also come to like coding and Digital Technology.

  In previous Digital Technology projects, we looked at using HTML to create a website. Due to this I have some knowledge of using HMTL.
